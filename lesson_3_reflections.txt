1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  There are many reasons for this but the main reasons are the following:
    - sharing my work with others
    - create a backup of my work

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I would like to control what is made public. I might still be trying out things and I might still be working on the changes.
