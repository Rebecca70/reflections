1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  There are many reasons for this but the main reasons are the following:
    - sharing my work with others
    - create a backup of my work

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I would like to control what is made public. I might still be trying out things and I might still be working on the changes.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  branch: creates a new 'direction' of your repository without terminating the old 'direction'. Work can be done on both branches
  individually and they can be merged later on if required.
  clone: a clone is a copy of a repository on GitHub to the a local place. It's a GitHub terminology.
  fork: creates a copy of an existing repository on GitHub which allows to trace back to the original repository

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
   I can work offline.
