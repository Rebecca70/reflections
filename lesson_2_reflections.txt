1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  It creates a place where the hidden git filese are stored.
  It's needed to be able to create and store commits.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area shows the files I want to commit but haven't been commited yet.
  The working directory is just a common folder.
  The staging area allows me to see/control easily what I want to commit.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
  I can compare the files in the staging area with the file which have not yet
  been commited or with the files which were commited at an earlier stage.
  This allows me to see what changes were really made and decide if they belong
  to the same logical change.

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
  If I want to try out a new feature but I'm not yet sure if I'm really going to use it.
  A branch allows me to keep the files at a certain stage (for example game works perfectly),
  but at the same time I can work on adding/chaning features without actually
  changing the original files.

5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
  They can make it clear which commit is related to which parent.
  Additionally, it shows easily the different branches. It can also
  show commits which are not linked to any branch.

6) What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
  The changes which were made independently on the two branches will be included in the remaining branch.
  It is represented as this in order to visualize the different branches, their parents and which
  commits might not be merged and why.

7) What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
  Automatic merges are much faster and with Git's ability, the risk of merging 'wrong' things
  is minimal. Git notifies me if a merge might be incorrect or might be causing issues. I
  can then decide if which part I want to merge of if the code needs updating in order to
  have a correct merge.
