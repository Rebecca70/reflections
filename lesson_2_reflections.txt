What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  It creates a place where the hidden git filese are stored.
  It's needed to be able to create and store commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area shows the files I want to commit but haven't been commited yet.
  The working directory is just a common folder.
  The staging area allows me to see/control easily what I want to commit.
